This project based on tic-tac-toe react application that developed on React tutorial [link to tutorial] (https://ru.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#completing-the-game). In the end of this tutorial, they offer by yourself complete additional exercises:

1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

In this practice project I complete this exercises.
